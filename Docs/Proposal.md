# The Template and Guideline for the Final Report

- This document serves as a guide for developing project proposal which will eventually become the proposal and final report.
- You start with the end in mind and adopt an agile approach:
  - Making progress continuously towards your goal.
  - Updating this document continuously along the way.

## 2. Background

- **What is it about?**  
→ The loan application analyzer project involves utilizing data  and machine learning models to analyze loan applications.  
→ The goal is likely to automate the decision-making process in approving or rejecting loan applications based on various factors such as (  
  Gender  
  Married status  
  Education  
  Employed status  
  Applicant / co-applicant Income  
  Loan amount  
  Credit History  
  Duration of the loan  
  Residence Area)  
  and historical data.  
→ This involves developing a predictive model that can assess the creditworthiness of applicants, ultimately streamlining and optimizing the loan approval process.

- **Why does it matter?**  
→ This project is significant and differnt to a conventional predicting methods because it helps in automating the decision-making process for loan approval, 
  making it faster, more accurate, and less biased.  
→ It seeks to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and fairness in the loan approval process by leveraging algorithms that can identify patterns and insights not readily 
  apparent through standard procedures.  
→ By predicting loan defaulters and assessing risk, it aids banks and financial institutions in minimizing losses and optimizing their loan approval process, thus 
  enhancing financial stability and customer satisfaction.

- **What are your research questions?**  
→  Can machine learning models accurately predict loan approval based on applicant data?  
→  Which features are most indicative of an applicant's creditworthiness and risk of defaulting on a loan?  
→  How do different machine learning algorithms compare in terms of accuracy and reliability for loan approval prediction?  
→  What strategies can be implemented to improve the model's prediction accuracy and reduce bias?
